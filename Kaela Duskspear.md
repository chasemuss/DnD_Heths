# Notes

A grizzled human woman in her late 40s, Kaela is the guildmaster of the [[Fiendslayers]]. Her face is scarred from a devil's claw, and her left arm is a prosthetic forged from infernal iron. She wields a massive Hellpiercer Land called *Soulrend*, said to scream when it strikes true. 

She is stern, uncompromising, and fiercely protective. She believes that the Hells can be beaten, not just contained, and she'll sacrifice anything or anyone to prove it. She's a hero to her guild, but her intensity unnerves outsiders.

Once a farmer's daughter, her village was razed by a devil's bargain gone wrong. She joined the Helldivers at 16 and climbed the ranks through sheer kill count. Now considered one of the best hunters, she's obsesses with finding the archdevil responsible for her past.

*Quirk* - She hums an old lullaby before she goes to the hells, a habit she started to comfort herself is now a good luck ritual.
