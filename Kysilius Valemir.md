# Notes

[Character Sheet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/150170811)

Kysilius grew up in [[name of bastion]] to a middle class family. One day, while Kysilius was attending to his mother's store, his father, a renowned fighter & [[Fiendslayers|Fiendslayer]], was killed on a mission to the Abyss to stop [[Belmordak, the Broken Choir]] from gathering enough strength to launch an attack on the Prime Material Plane. He died to protect his comrades from annihilation. The survivors escaped back home with nothing more than his father's cape, face mask, and dying wish, "Allow Kysilius to join." [[Kaela Duskspear|Kaela]] was the one who promised to fulfill this request. She travelled to the shop, cape & mask in hand, and delivered it to Kysilius, saying that if he ever aspired to be more, go to the guildhall for the Fiendslayers. To gain entrance, just mention his last name, Valemir, and he'll gain the rank of Initiate. 

After speaking with his mom, and being reassured by her that she'll be fine and can manage the store, he ran to the guildhall, eager to take up his father's mantle and live up to his legacy. The way there, he remembered all the times his father took him into the alley by their house and trained him how to fight with a greatsword and glaive. He rapped urgently on the door, and a peephole opened. He nearly shouted out his surname, and the door swung open. Inside, there were men and women armored and armed to the teeth. They were drinking and eating. A few were fighting in the corner, claiming to be the stronger. Upon entering, the whole hall seemed to freeze. The air was so quiet, a mouse was heard squeaking while he dragged some cheese into the wall. Each member raised a fist in reverence to Kysilius' father, and the man who opened the door whispered to him, "You should go see Kaela, she's in that room" and pointed to a room just off the main guildhall. 

Kysilius awkwardly walked towards the room, not sure what to make of the hall of eyes looking at him with respect and anticipation of what he'll become. As he went through the door, he felt the air behind him relax and the usual noise level returned. Kaela was behind a desk. A large grizzled woman in her late 40s, she had been the leader of the Fiendslayers for nearly a decade and it was quite evident from her wounds. She had an infernal iron prosthetic arm and a scar that went from temple to cheek. Behind her was a large lance. Kysilius had heard of this weapon, whispering its name *Soulrend*. Kaela looked at Kysilius with a stern look that slowly turned softer, and said "You'll make a fine addition to our motley crew of fighters. What's your specialty?" Kysilius, gathering the courage he could to speak with how nervous he was, responded with "Great weapons mostly. Specializing in greatswords and glaives." 

"I'm not surprised in the slightest. You are your father's son. Welcome to the guild."

As he went on missions and proved his capability to destroy demons, he took up the following oath

> Before flame, I do not falter. Before the abyss, I draw my blade.
> 
> I swear this oath by steel and soul:
> 
> I shall not bargain with devils, nor heed the lies of demons.
> Their words are poison, their promises a snare. I will meet them with silence and a sharpened edge.
>
> I shall bring conquest to chaos and death to the damned.
> Not for glory. Not for vengeance. But because it must be done.
>
> I shall be the bulwark where infernal fire breaks.
> My will shall be iron. My purpose unbending. My presence a cage.
>
> I shall not flinch before darkness, nor falter in despair.
> Even should the heavens retreat, I will stand, the last sentinel between this world and the pit.
>
> I shall chain my wrath and master my strength.
> For only through control can evil be bound. And only through order can evil be destroyed.
>
> This I vow:  
> That no fiend shall pass where I tread.  
> That no pact shall survive where I strike.  
> That no corruption shall linger where I burn the ground clean.
>
> By law, by flame, by conquestâ€”so do I bind myself. So do I become a Fiendslayer

After several years of missions, Kysilius grew in power, awakening his divine lineage after killing some shadow demons. Other members of the guild were astonished to see this, saying that while they knew his father had a spark of divinity, they didn't think it was hereditary and that the ones who sought out holiness as a means to combat the fiends gained it through pacts with celestials. They recommended that he continue to train this talent. 

He continued to work up the ranks through the guild, from Initiate -> Adept -> Sentinel. Upon receiving this title, Kaela said that he has to go into the world and achieve greatness to earn the next rank of Commander to prove that he was a good fit for the role and truly good enough to be given the responsibilities. They gave him the funding he needed and sent him to [[location of the rest of the party]] because they had heard [[plot point]] was there.
